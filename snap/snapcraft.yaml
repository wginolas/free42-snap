summary: An HP-42S Calculator Simulator
description: |
  Free42 is a re-implementation of the HP-42S Scientific Programmable Calculator
  and HP-82240 Printer.  It is a complete rewrite, not using any HP code. It does
  not require an HP-42S ROM image.  Even though it contains significant
  enhancements compared to the original calculator, Free42 remains fully
  compatible with the HP-42S, both in its user interface and in its ability to run
  programs written for the HP-42S.
